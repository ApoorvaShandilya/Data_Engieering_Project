# Data_Engineering_Project
## Project Objective: Creating an Efficient Data Pipeline
This project is about Gans, a company that shares E-Scooters.
We want to create a system that easily gathers, works with, and saves data from different places.
The big idea is to learn things from this data to help us make smart choices.
We're going to switch from doing this on one computer to using the cloud, so it can grow and work by itself.
